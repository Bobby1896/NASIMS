## NASIMS – Bootstrap Mockup Website

**NASIMS** is one of my earliest front-end development projects, created as a **mockup version** of the official website of the **National Social Investment Management System (NASIMS)** in Nigeria. Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**, this project focuses on responsive layout, structured design, and component-based web development using the Bootstrap framework.

### 🔍 Project Overview

NASIMMS is a static website that simulates the core design and structure of the actual NASIMS platform. It was developed to practice using **Bootstrap's grid system**, utility classes, and UI components to create a clean, accessible, and responsive website.

Though it doesn’t include any backend or interactive functionality, the project demonstrates how a real-world public sector website might look in a front-end implementation.
